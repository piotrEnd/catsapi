**Information architecture:**

[TheCatApi](https://docs.thecatapi.com/) offers several preset options for filtering search queries. However, previously, there was no direct method to get results based on a single temperament trait. But that has changed. The left sidebar contains a list of traits. Simply click to retrieve matching breeds. The results are showcased in a main view. Concise breed description, other traits, and a photo facilitate easy comparisons.

**Design:**

Now, you can discover the perfect cat to interact with, whether it's 'talkative', 'mischievous', or any other trait you prefer. All essential content is presented on a single webpage. Fast and efficient user experience. A handwritten, decorative font imparts an alluring touch to the breed name. The body text features a modern appearance that harmonizes well with the sovereign nature of cat keepers.
