**Design:**


[TheCatApi](https://docs.thecatapi.com/) enables by default few options to filter search queries. Although there is no direct way to extract results basing on single temperament trait. If a cat is a human in fur, then from now on you can choose deliberately 'talkative' one. Relax, 'mischievous' is an option too.
